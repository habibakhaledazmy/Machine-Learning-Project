# Machine-Learning-Project
Machine Learning project to predict anxiety and depression response groups using CDC mental health data. Includes model training, evaluation, and Streamlit app deployment.
# Anxiety & Depression Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning to classify mental health survey responses into two groups (early and late), based on indicators of anxiety or depression.

---

##  Problem Statement

Using CDC mental health survey data, my goal was to build a classification model that predicts whether a person belongs to an early or late response group based on weekly survey data.

---

##  Dataset

- Source: [CDC Mental Health Indicators]
- Features used:
  - `Subgroup` (categorical demographic variable)
  - `Value` (percentage reporting mental health symptoms)
  - `Time Period` (week number)
- Target Variable: `Group_Label` (0 for weeks 11â€“25, 1 for weeks 26â€“52)

---

##  Preprocessing

- Missing values dropped
- `Subgroup` encoded using LabelEncoder
- `Value` normalized using StandardScaler
- Final features: `Subgroup_encoded`, `Value`

##  Models Trained

| Model              | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | AUC  |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.78     | 0.70      | 0.68   | 0.69     | 0.80 |
| **Random Forest** (Final Model) | **0.84** | **0.83** | **0.81** | **0.82** | **0.89** |
| XGBoost            | 0.89     | 0.88      | 0.87   | 0.875    | 0.94 |

Final model selected: **Random Forest**

##  Deployment

Deployed using Streamlit. The app allows users to input:
- Subgroup
- Value
- Time Period

And returns a prediction: Group 0 (early) or Group 1 (late).
